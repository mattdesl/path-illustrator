Work in progress. A client interface for drawing lines, curves and shapes with familiar Photoshop tools and keybaord shortcuts.

Current features:

- modular, is not tied to a larger application
- curve adjustment (both controls together, or separately)
- can move points or full path
- add / remove points along line
- undo / redo

The end goals for the project [described here](https://github.com/mattdesl/path-illustrator-client).
